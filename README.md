## About

Conflux Program - BeiDou - Team CutoffX  
BeiDou (ÂåóÊñó) is a blockchain entrepreneurship camp hosted by the Shanghai Tree Map Blockchain Research Institute and the Conflux Blockchain Foundation.

In this hackathon-ish event, a group of six UofT graduates completed this project, Infty.

Infty is an easy-to-use NFT trading platform on the Conflux blockchain, with a variety of features, including raffles, fractional trading, staking, and more to add.

### Built With

-   [Conflux Blockchain](https://confluxnetwork.org/)
-   Vue.js + Express.js + MongoDB
-   Solidity

Note: the database currently used is publicly accessible, and only used for testing purposes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) / [docker](docker.com)
-   clone the repo and the submodules into the your local computer
-   **Ask the team for the .env file**

### Usage

#### With Docker

```
docker build -t infty
docker run -p 3001:3001 infty
```

#### With NPM

```
cd infty && npm i && npm run build
rm -rf ../backend/src/views && cp -r dist/* ../backend/src/views/
cd ../backend && npm i && node src/index.js
```

#### Development Mode

Run two terminals. Also, need to change the variable `apiUrl` in [store.js](infty/src/store.js) to `http://localhost:3001/api`.

Terminal 1 (front end running at port 8080):

```
cd infty && npm i && npm run serve
```

Terminal 2 (backend running at port 3001):

```
cd backend && npm i && node src/index.js
```

#### Last step

Then launch http://localhost:3001.
It's also deployed at http://infty.market.

## Roadmap

## Contributing

Due to school or work, the original team members may not be able to contribute as much after the end of the program, but at Conflux, we have a strong community.
Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Contributions are what makes the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are **greatly appreciated**.

Please try to create bug reports that are:

-   _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the problem.
-   _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
-   _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing opened issues.
-   _Scoped to a Single Bug._ One bug per report.

You could use [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) to check for common markdown style inconsistency.
